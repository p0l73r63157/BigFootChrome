## Passive Recconeiscance for Chrome Browser
(works with Opera too)

This Chrome Extension is inspired by old Firefox plugin called PassivRecon. This extension works the same way, incorporating the same websites, and even more of them. There are two menus available: context menu and plugin menu (via Foot icon). Right click context menu works on the content of currently opened page, while extension menu provides other useful sites used for penetration testing.
